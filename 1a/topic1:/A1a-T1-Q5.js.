//First I defined and intialised variables//

let a1 = 1, b1 = 2;

//Then I defined an intialised a temporary variable (tmp)//

let tmp = 0;

//Then I 'poured' the value of b1 into the temporary variable//

tmp = b1;

//Then I 'poured' the value of a1 into b1//

b1 = a1;

//Then I 'poured' the value of tmp into a1//

a1 = tmp;

let combinedstring = a1 + "," + b1;

//Proof//

console.log(combinedstring);
